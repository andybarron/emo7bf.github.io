      Welcome to my site! My name is Elizabeth Orrico. I am currently a first year student at the University of Southern California. I am pursuing a doctorate in Computer Science under the advisement of Professor Milind Tambe. The focus of my research group, Teamcore, is artificial intelligence and game theory in security domains.
    </p>
    <p>
      I graduated with a BS in Electrical Engineering from University of Virginia in 2015. During my time at UVa, I focused on image processing algorithms for biomedical, astronomy, and commercial applications.

    <p>
      I am also interested in computer science education and in promoting the participation of women and under-represented minorities in computer science.
